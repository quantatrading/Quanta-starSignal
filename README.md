# About Quanta starSignal

Quanta starSignal uses advanced market pressure metrics, order book data, and custom-developed indicators like the BMPI (Buy Market Pressure Indicator). It trades when the market shifts between buyer and seller control.

starSignal is built with simplicity and precision in mind. Its purpose is to offer trading intelligence for people who want an easy, out-of-the-box experience. With a “zero complexity” setup, users choose a trading persona, like the current ‘scalper’. There is no algorithm tuning required.
